# üåê GARCH-Volatility Modelling for EUR/USD Exchange Rate üìä

Welcome to the **GARCH Volatility Modelling** project, where we explore the dynamics of the **EUR/USD exchange rate** using the **GARCH(p,q)** model! üåçüìà

In this project, we:
- üì• Download historical data for the EUR/USD exchange rate.
- üßÆ Compute **log returns** for the exchange rate.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Fit a **GARCH(p,q)** model to log returns.
- üéØ Use **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)** and **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)** to determine the optimal parameters `(p, q)`.
- üîÆ Predict future log returns using the optimal model and compare them with actual log returns for accuracy.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection - EUR/USD Exchange Rate Data

We use the **Yahoo Finance** library to retrieve data for the EUR/USD exchange rate from **2019-01-01** to **2023-12-31**.

```python
# Downloading the historical exchange rate data
data = yf.download('EURUSD=X', start='2019-01-01', end='2023-12-31')
data.head(10)
```

# Daily Log Returns Calculation

This section describes how to calculate the daily log returns for a stock's adjusted closing prices.

```python
df['Daily Log Returns'] = np.log(df['Adj Close'] / df['Adj Close'].shift(1))
df.head(10)
log_returns = df['Daily Log Returns'].dropna()
log_returns
```

# Interactive Log Returns vs. Date

This section presents an interactive graph of daily log returns plotted against the date.

# Distribution of Log Returns

This section includes histograms to visualize the distribution of daily log returns, checking the assumptions of the GARCH model.

## Histogram with Normal Distribution Line

This histogram displays the log returns with a normal distribution line traced on the histogram.

# Q-Q Plots of Log Returns

This section includes Q-Q plots to assess the distribution of daily log returns. The first plot compares the log returns to a normal distribution, while the second plot compares the log returns to a t-distribution.

## Q-Q Plot with Normal Distribution

This Q-Q plot displays the log returns against the theoretical quantiles of the normal distribution.

# GARCH Model

The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is a statistical model used to analyze and forecast the volatility of financial time series data. It is particularly useful for modeling situations where the variance of the error terms varies over time, a phenomenon known as conditional heteroskedasticity. GARCH models allow for the estimation of time-varying volatility, capturing the clustering effect often observed in financial returns, where high-volatility periods tend to be followed by high-volatility periods and low-volatility periods by low-volatility periods.

## GARCH(p, q) Model Formula

The GARCH(p, q) model is defined by the following equations:

1. **Return Equation:**
   r_t = Œº + Œµ_t

2. **Conditional Variance Equation:**
   œÉ_t¬≤ = Œ±‚ÇÄ + Œ£ (from i=1 to p) Œ±_i Œµ_{t-i}¬≤ + Œ£ (from j=1 to q) Œ≤_j œÉ_{t-j}¬≤

Where:
- r_t is the return at time t,
- Œº is the mean of the returns,
- Œµ_t is the error term (residual) at time t,
- œÉ_t¬≤ is the conditional variance at time t,
- Œ±‚ÇÄ is a constant term,
- Œ±_i are the coefficients for the lagged squared residuals (error terms),
- Œ≤_j are the coefficients for the lagged conditional variances,
- p is the order of the GARCH term (number of lagged variances),
- q is the order of the ARCH term (number of lagged errors).

This model provides a framework for capturing the dynamics of volatility in financial markets, making it a fundamental tool in econometrics and finance.
